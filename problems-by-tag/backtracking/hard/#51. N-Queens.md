# 51. N-Queens

## Description

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n√ón` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

The way a queen can move is that a queen is allowed to move in any direction horizontally (4 directions). It can move to the left or to the right. It can move up or down. And a queen also can move diagonally (positive diagonal and negative diagonal).

Given an integer `n`, return all **distinct solutions** to the n-queens puzzle.

## Constraints

- You may return the anwser **in any order**.

- `1 <= n <= 9`

## Approach
- Choice

    We can place character `Q` in any cell of the chessboard.

- Constraints

    Each queen is in a different row.

    Each queen is in a different column.

    Each queen is in a separate positive diagonal.

    Each queen is in a separate negative diagonal.

    The pattern that we compute the indices for positive diganoal and negative diagnoal:

    1. positive diganoal index: (row + col)

    2. negative diagonal index: (row - col)

- Goals

    The recursion function reaches out to the boundary of row in chessboard.
