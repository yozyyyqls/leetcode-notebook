# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Description

You are given two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge two lists in a one sorted list.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

## Constraints

- The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the `range [0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Approach

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(m+n)
# space complexity: O(m+n), The first call to mergeTwoLists does not return until the ends of both l1 and l2 have been reached, so (n+m) stack frames consume O(n+m) space.

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        if list1 is None: return list2
        if list2 is None: return list1

        if list1.val <= list2.val:
            list1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(list1.next, list2)
            return list1
        else:
            list2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(list1, list2.next)
            return list2
```
