# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

## Description

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

## Constraints

- You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.
- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Approach: Recursion

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(n/k)

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        if k == 1:
            return head

        # return the new head of list after reversing
        def reverseK(start) -> Optional[ListNode]:
            # there's no node need to reverse
            if start == None:
                return start

            end = start
            for i in range(k - 1):
                end = None if end == None else end.next

            # there's not enough nodes for reversing
            if end == None:
                return start

            # the tail node for the current k-group nodes
            # those nodes at the right of the tail have been reversed
            tail = reverseK(end.next)

            p = start
            while tail != end:
                # save the node we need to manipulate next
                next = p.next
                # do the reversing
                p.next = tail
                # now p should join the reversed-group
                tail = p
                p = next

            return tail

        return reverseK(head)
