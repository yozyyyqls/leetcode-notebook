# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

## Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the longest substring of `s` such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to `k`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## Approach

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(maxUnique * n) = O(n), because the maximum value of maxUnique is 26.
# space complexity: O(1), because the string only contains lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:

        # the number of the unique character in the string
        maxUnique = len(set(s))
        ans = 0

        # the currUnique is the number of unique characters in the sliding window
        for currUnique in range(1, maxUnique + 1):
            count = {}
            l = 0
            for r in range(len(s)):
                count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r], 0)

                # shrink the sliding window if the number of unique characters is greater than the currUnique
                while len(count) > currUnique:
                    if count[s[l]] == 1: del count[s[l]]
                    else: count[s[l]] -= 1
                    l += 1

                # keep track of the number of unique characters in the sliding window having at least k frequency
                # update the anwser if the frequency of all characters in the sliding window is greater or equal to k
                isUpdateAns = True
                for frequency in count.values():
                    if frequency < k:
                        isUpdateAns = False
                        break
                
                if isUpdateAns: ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)

        return ans
