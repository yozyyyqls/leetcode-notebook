# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Description

Given s string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Constraints

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Approach

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(min{m,n}), The size of the Set is upper bounded by the size of the string n and the size of the charset/alphabet m.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:

        n = len(s)

        count = {}
        ans = 0

        l, r = 0, 0
        while r < n:
            ch = s[r]
            count[ch] = 1 + count.get(ch, 0)

            while count[ch] > 1:
                chLeftmost = s[l]
                count[chLeftmost] -= 1
                l += 1

            r += 1    
            ans = max(ans, r - l)

        return ans
