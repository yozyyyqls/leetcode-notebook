# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

## Description

Given a linked list of length `n`.

Each node contains an additional ramdom pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a **deep copy** of this list. The deep copy list should consist of `n` brand new nodes. Both the `next` and `random` pointer should point to the new nodes in the copied list.

## Constraints

- 0 <= n <= 1000
- -104 <= Node.val <= 10^4
- `Node.random` is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
- The list allows to have duplicate node value.

## Approach

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(n)

"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        # the edge case
        if head == None:
            return head

        # the dummy head of the copied linked list
        dummy = Node(0)
        tail = dummy

        # pair: {old node : new node}
        hashmap = {}

        # the first iteration
        # build the next chain of the copied list and build the hashmap
        p = head
        while p != None:
            tail.next = Node(p.val)
            tail = tail.next
            hashmap[p] = tail

            p = p.next

        # second iteration,  build the random chain of the copied list
        p = dummy.next
        q = head
        while p != None:
            oldRandom = q.random
            newRandom = hashmap[oldRandom] if oldRandom != None else None
            p.random = newRandom

            p = p.next
            q = q.next

        return dummy.next
