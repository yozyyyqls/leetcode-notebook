# 387. First Unique Character in a String

## Description

Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

Example:
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Approach: Hash Map

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1), because the string only contains the lowercase letters.

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:

        first = -1

        occurrence = Counter(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            ch = s[i]
            if occurrence[ch] == 1:
                first = i
                break

        return first
```
