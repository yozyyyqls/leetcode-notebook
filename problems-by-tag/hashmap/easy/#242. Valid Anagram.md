# 242. Valid Anagram

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Follow up**: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Approach: HashMap

We can count the occurrence of each letter in the two strings and compare them. We could use a hash table to count the frequency of each letter too.

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n), depends on the implementation of the Counter.
# space complexity: O(1), the string only contains lowercase letters.

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

        sCount = Counter(s)
        tCount = Counter(t)

        return sCount == tCount
```

**Anwser** of the 'Follow up':

Use a hash table instead of a fixed size counter. Imagine allocating a large size array to fit the entire range of unicode characters, which could go up to more than 1 million.
