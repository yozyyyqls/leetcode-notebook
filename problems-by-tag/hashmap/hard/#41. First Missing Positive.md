# 41. First Missing Positive

## Description

Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

example:
```
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The length of integer array is 5.
There is missing [1,2,3,4,5].
So the smallest positive integer 1 is missing.
```

## Constraints

- You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses constant extra space.
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach

```python

# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1)

class Solution:
    def swap(self, nums, i, j):
        temp = nums[i]
        nums[i] = nums[j]
        nums[j] = temp

    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        n = len(nums)

        # the first iteration
        # put every number in their correct position
        # if the current number is in the range(1,n+1), we must care about it
        # if the current number is negative or is non-negative but duplicate, we just ignore it
        # example 1: the number 3 should be placed in the position of index 2
        for i in range(n):
            # condition 1 and condition 2 make sure the curren number is in the range(1, n+1)
            # condition 3 checks if the current number is in the correct position
            # condition 4 filters the duplicate positive number
            while nums[i] > 0 and nums[i] <= n and nums[i] != (i + 1) and nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]:
                self.swap(nums, i, nums[i] - 1)

        firstMissing = n + 1
        for i in range(n):
            num = nums[i]
            # if we find a wrong number in the current place
            # it means the number (i+1) is missing
            if num != (i + 1):
                firstMissing = i + 1
                break
                
        return firstMissing
```
