# 739. Daily Temperatures

## Description

Given an array of integers `temperatures` the daily temperatures, return an array `anwser` that `anwser[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `i^th` day to get a warmer temperature.

If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `anwser[i] == 0` instead.

## Constraints

- `1 <= temperatures.length <= 105`
- `30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100`

## Approach 1: Brute Solution (Time Limit Exceeded)

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n^2)
# space complexity: O(n)

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        n = len(temperatures)
        ans = [0] * n

        for i in range(n):
            days = 0
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                days += 1
                if temperatures[j] > temperatures[i]:
                    ans[i] = days
                    break

        return ans
```

## Approach 2: Stack

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(n)

"""
At first glance, it may look like the time complexity of this algorithm should be O(N^2),
because there is a nested while loop inside the for loop.
However, each element can only be added to the stack once, which means the stack is limited to N pops.
Every iteration of the while loop uses 1 pop, which means the while loop will not iterate more than NNN times in total, across all iterations of the for loop.

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        n = len(temperatures)
        ans = [0] * n

        # the temperatures in the stack have not been predicted
        stack = []

        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and t > stack[-1][0]:
                stackT, stackInd = stack.pop()
                ans[stackInd] = i - stackInd
            stack.append([t, i])

        return ans
