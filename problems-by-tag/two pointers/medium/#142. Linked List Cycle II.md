# 142. Linked List Cycle II

## Descrption

Given an linked list, return the node where the cycle begins.

If there is no cycle, return `null`.

## Constraints

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.

`-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

`pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

## Approach

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1)

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # edge case 1:the linked list has no node
        # edge case 2: the linked list only has one node
        if not head or not head.next:
            return None

        # find out whether the linked list has a cycle or not
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
            if fast: fast = fast.next

            if slow == fast:
                break

        # if the linked list has a cycle, find out the begin of the cycle

        # the fast pointer exceeds the boundary means there's no cycle in the linked list
        if not fast:
            return None

        # otherwise, find out the begin of the cycle
        # to find the entrance to the cycle, we use two pointers
        # the slow pointer points at the head of the linked list
        # the fast pointer stay at in place
        # then we traverse the linked list at the same speed (speed one)
        slow = head
        while slow != fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next

        return fast
