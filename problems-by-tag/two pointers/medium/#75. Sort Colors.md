# 75. Sort Colors

## Description

Given an array with `n` objects colored red, white or blue.

Sort them in place so that the objects of the same color are adjacent, with the color in the order red, white, and blue.

- `0` represents red.
- `1` represents white.
- `2` represents blue.

## Constraints

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

`n == nums.length`

`1 <= n <= 300`

`nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Approach (Optimal Soluton: O(1) space)

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1)

class Solution:

    def swap(self, nums, i, j):
        temp = nums[i]
        nums[i] = nums[j]
        nums[j] = temp


    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """

        n = len(nums)

        # if the array has only one element
        # no need for sorting
        if n == 1:
            return

        # slot: the numbers before the slot have been sorted
        # walk: iterate through the subarry[slot, n - 1] (close interval) to find out the target color and insert it into the slot
        slot = 0
        for target in range(0, 3):
            for walk in range(slot, n):
                if nums[walk] == target:
                    # find a target and insert it in slot
                    # then update the slot
                    self.swap(nums, slot, walk)
                    slot += 1
```
