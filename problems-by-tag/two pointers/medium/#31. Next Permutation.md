# 31. Next Permutation

## Description

A **permutaion** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- example:

    for `[1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of it: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of an integers is the next lexicographical greater permutation of its integer.

- example:

    the next permutation of `[1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.

    the next permutation of `[3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]`, because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an arrany of integers `nums`, find the next permutation of it.

## Constraints
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

`1 <= nums.length <= 100`

`0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Approach

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1)

class Solution:
    def swap(self, nums, i, j):
        """
        swap two elements in the input array
        """
        temp = nums[i]
        nums[i] = nums[j]
        nums[j] = temp

    def reverse(self, nums, i, j):
        """
        reverse the input array from index i to index j (closed interval)
        """
        while i <= j:
            self.swap(nums, i, j)
            i += 1
            j -= 1

    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(nums)

        # iterate through the nums array
        # from end to start
        # find the first decresing subarray[a, b] (closed interval), name it 'firstDes'
        # get the index 'b - 1', which is the index of the penultimate number in the 'firstDec'
        dec = -1
        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
                dec = i - 1
                break

        # iterate through the nums array
        # from end to start
        # find the first number greater than the firstDec(a - 1) in nums[a, n - 1]
        if dec != -1:
            greater = dec
            for i in range(n - 1, dec, -1):
                if nums[i] > nums[dec]:
                    greater = i
                    break

            # swap numbers at 'dec' index and 'greater' index
            self.swap(nums, dec, greater)

        # reverse the subarray[dec + 1, n - 1]
        self.reverse(nums, dec + 1, n - 1)
