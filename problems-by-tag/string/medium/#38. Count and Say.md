# 38. Count and Say

## Description

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

Example:
```python
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 30`

## Approach

```python
# python3

# Time Complexity: ?
# Space Complexity: O(1), we don't consider the space cost of recursion.

class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        if n == 1:
            return "1"

        say = self.countAndSay(n - 1)

        ans = ""

        # count the frequency
        # pay attention to the eage case:
        # for instance: 1 1 1 2 2 1
        #                         l r
        l, r = 0, 0
        while r <= len(say):
            if r < len(say) and say[l] == say[r]:
                r += 1
            else:
                ans += str(r - l) + say[l]
                l = r
                if r == len(say):
                    break

        return ans
```
