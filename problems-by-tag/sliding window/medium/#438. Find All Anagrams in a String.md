# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

## Description

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`.

A anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a diiferent word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Constraints

- You may return the anwser in any order.
- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Approach: HashMap

Use a hashmap to track the element in sliding window. Then compare the hashmap of sliding window to the hashmap of counting of the p.

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(1)

# count_p and count_s contain K elements each.
# since K is fixed at 26 for this problem, this can be considered as O(1) space.

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        # the edge case
        if len(p) > len(s): return ans

        ns = len(s)
        count_p = Counter(p)
        count_s = Counter()

        l, r = 0, 0
        while r < ns:
            count_s[s[r]] = 1 + count_s.get(s[r], 0)

            if count_s == count_p:
                ans.append(l)

            # update the left pointer
            if r - l + 1 == len(p):
                if count_s[s[l]] == 1:
                    del count_s[s[l]]
                else:
                    count_s[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            # update the right pointer
            r += 1

        return ans
