# 239. Sliding Window Maximum

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.

You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return all the max number in the sliding window.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

## Approach: Deque

```python
# python3

# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(n)

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:

        n = len(nums)

        left, right = 0, 0
        q = collections.deque()
        ans = []

        while right < n:

            # make sure the indices in queue are in the sliding window range
            if q and left > q[0]:
                q.popleft()
            
            # make sure the numbers corresponding to the indices in the queue are decreasing order
            # otherwise, pop the number which is greater than the current number from queue
            while q and nums[right] >= nums[q[-1]]:
                q.pop()

            q.append(right)

            #  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 (k=3)
            # l,r

            #  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 (k=3)
            #  l    r

            #  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 (k=3)
            #  l         r

            #  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 (k=3)
            #       l         r
            if right + 1 >= k:
                left += 1
                ans.append(nums[q[0]])
            right += 1

        return ans
